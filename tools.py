"""
The three FitFindr tools.

Each one is a standalone function you can call and test on its own, before any
of them are wired into the loop. Build and test them one at a time — three
untested tools joined by a loop is one problem that looks like six, because you
can't tell which layer is lying to you.

    search_listings(description, size, max_price)  → list[dict]
    suggest_outfit(new_item, wardrobe)             → str
    create_fit_card(outfit, new_item)              → str

All three are stubs right now. They run and they do nothing — that's the
starting position and it's deliberate.

⚠️ Before you write any of them, fill in the **Tool Inventory** section of your
README (Milestone 2). Four lines per tool: what it does, each input with its
type, exactly what it returns, and what it returns when it has nothing to give.
That last line is what your loop branches on. "Returns a list" earns nothing —
the description has to say what is *in* the list.

    """
    Search the listings data for items matching a description, and optionally a
    size and a price ceiling.

    This is the tool that doesn't call the model, which makes it the easiest one
    to test and the one to move onto MCP in unit 4.

    Args:
        description: keywords describing what the user wants
                     (e.g. "vintage graphic tee").
        size:        a size string to filter by, or None to skip size filtering.
                     Match case-insensitively — "M" should match "S/M".
        max_price:   maximum price, inclusive, or None to skip price filtering.

    Returns:
        A list of matching listing dicts, best match first.
        Returns an empty list when nothing matches — an empty list, not None,
        and not an exception. Your loop branches on this.

    Each listing dict has these fields:
        id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size,
        condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str or None), platform

    Test it from a terminal before you move on:

    Given a thrifted item and the user's wardrobe, suggest one or two outfits.

    This one calls the model, through `generate()`. You don't need to think
    about rate limits — the adapter handles pacing for you.

    Args:
        new_item: a listing dict — the item the user is considering.
        wardrobe: a wardrobe dict with an 'items' key holding a list of items.
                  It may be empty. Handle that.

    Returns:
        A non-empty string with outfit suggestions.
        With an empty wardrobe, return general styling advice rather than
        raising or returning "".

    Returns:
        A two-to-four sentence caption.

        than raising.
